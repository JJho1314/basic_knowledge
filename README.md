# Things to learn for new students

## Software Programming

Learn the following two programing langrages

* C (C99)
* Python (v3.0)

Do the following projects to practice and learn good habits when programming in C

* [codewithc](https://www.codewithc.com/c-projects-with-source-code/)

## Hardware Basic Knowledge

Read the following two books to learn basic concepts for computer architecture. Important things to understand include pipeline, memory hierarchy, roofline model, Amdahl's law, ILP (instruction level parallelism), TLP (task level parallelism), DLP (data level parallelism), SIMD/VLIW processor

* ''Computer Organization and Design The Hardware Software Interface'', 3rd Edition, 2004
* ''Computer Architecture A Quantitative Approach'', 6th Edition, 2019


## FPGA Design

Read the following book to learn OpenCL programing (GPU/FPGA):

* ''OpenCL Programming Guide'', Aaftab Munshi, et.al., 2012  [also known as The Green Book]
* [''FPGA异构计算――基于OpenCL的开发方法''](https://baike.baidu.com/item/FPGA%E5%BC%82%E6%9E%84%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E5%9F%BA%E4%BA%8EOpenCL%E7%9A%84%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95), 黄乐天 等, 2015

Also, refers to Intel/Xilinx's OpenCL user guide to learn specific techniques that will be used in the project.

*  [''面向 OpenCL 的英特尔 FPGA SDK 最佳实践指南''](https://www.intel.cn/content/www/cn/zh/programmable/products/design-software/embedded-software-developers/opencl/support.html)

Finally, learn our opensource project [PipeCNN](https://github.com/doonny/PipeCNN). Run the examples, such as caffenet, vgg-16, resnet, YOLO on the DE10-nano and DE5-net platforms. Learn how to configure, compile, debug the source codes and profile the performance of the accelerator.


## GPU Design

Learn TensorRT and CUDA programing. Try examples on our TX2/TK1 platforms.

* [TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt)
