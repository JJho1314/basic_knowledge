## FPGA Design

Read the following book to learn OpenCL programing (GPU/FPGA):

* ''OpenCL Programming Guide'', Aaftab Munshi, et.al., 2012  [also known as The Green Book]
* [''FPGA异构计算――基于OpenCL的开发方法''](https://baike.baidu.com/item/FPGA%E5%BC%82%E6%9E%84%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E5%9F%BA%E4%BA%8EOpenCL%E7%9A%84%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95), 黄乐天 等, 2015

Also, refers to Intel/Xilinx's OpenCL user guide to learn specific techniques that will be used in the project.

*  [''面向 OpenCL 的英特尔 FPGA SDK 最佳实践指南''](https://www.intel.cn/content/www/cn/zh/programmable/products/design-software/embedded-software-developers/opencl/support.html)

Finally, learn our opensource project [PipeCNN](https://github.com/doonny/PipeCNN). Run the examples, such as caffenet, vgg-16, resnet, YOLO on the DE10-nano and DE5-net platforms. Learn how to configure, compile, debug the source codes and profile the performance of the accelerator.

Zhang DeZheng has wrote a good study note on PipeCNN, please read it [here](https://github.com/doonny/basic_knowledge/blob/master/PipeCNN_note.md).

## GPU Design

Learn TensorRT and CUDA programing. Try examples on our TX2/TK1 platforms.

* [TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt)


## Tutorials for Hardware Architectures for DNN

Students who are working on hardware designs for deep neural networks should read the following tutorials.

* [Hardware Architectures for Deep Neural Networks](http://eyeriss.mit.edu/tutorial.html), MICRO Tutorial 2016.


## For Phd. Students

First, read the following artichles to learn how to write research papers.
